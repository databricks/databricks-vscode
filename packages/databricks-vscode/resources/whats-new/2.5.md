### <a id="validation"></a> Validation and partial update actions for pipelines

In previous versions you can only trigger a “refresh all” pipeline update. Now we offer validation and partial update actions:

In addition to that, partial update action preload datasets from past runs, lets you type in table names manually, or select full-refresh option:

### <a id="events"></a> Pipeline's events and diagnostics

During and after a pipeline update, the extension now shows events in the resource explorer UI:

Any warnings or errors that have source location are also displayed in the VSCode’s Problems panel, and highlighted in the source files themselves:

### <a id="datasets"></a> Pipeline's datasets and their schema

You can now see pipeline's datasets and their schema:

Datasets are gathered from the events of the past runs, so make sure to update or validate your pipeline at least once.

### <a id="quick-run"></a> Quick run action

All run and update actions used to be tied to resource explorer UI, but now you can also use a "deploy the bundle and run a resource" command from the command pallete or with a keyboard shortcut:

By default, we will ask you what resource you want to execute:

You can also specify a shortcut run the command with specific arguments.

Open keyboard shorcuts JSON (execute this command `Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)`). Add a new entry to the `keybindings` array:

```json
{
    // Replace with your desired shortcut
    "key": "ctrl+shift+x",
    "command": "databricks.bundle.deployAndRunFromInput",
    "args": {
        // "jobs" or "pipelines"
        "resourceType": "pipelines",
        // The key of the pipeline or job you want to run, as defined in you asset bundle configuration
        "resourceKey": "my_pipeline_key",
        // Any flags that will be passed to the "databricks bundle run" command
        "args": "--validate-only"
    }
},
```
