# Databricks Extension v2.4.0

## What's new?

-   [Databricks Asset Bundles support](#dabs)
-   [Bundle configuration](#dabs-config)
-   [No environment variables in terminals](#no-env)

### <a id="dabs"></a> Databricks Asset Bundles support

The extension now supports [Databricks Asset Bundles](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/bundles/index.html)! New features include:

-   Easy authentication and configuration of your Databricks Asset Bundles through the Visual Studio Code UI, including **AuthType** profile selection.
-   A **Target** selector in the Databricks extension panel to quickly switch between bundle target environments.
-   The **Override Jobs cluster** in bundle option in the extension panel to enable easy cluster override.
-   A **Bundles Resource Explorer** view, which allows you to browse your bundle resources using the Visual Studio Code UI, deploy your local Databricks Asset Bundleâ€™s resources to your remote Databricks workspace with a single click, and go directly to your deployed resources in your workspace from Visual Studio Code.
-   A **Bundles Variables View**, which enables you to browse and edit your bundle variables using the Visual Studio Code UI. See Bundle Variables View.

See [our documentation for more information](https://docs..databricks.com/dev-tools/vscode-ext/bundles.html).

### <a id="dabs-config"></a> Bundle configuration

The extension now requires a bundle configuration to be present in the project.

If you don't use Databricks Asset Bundles, the extension will ask you to "migrate" your project. This will only create a `databricks.yml` configuration file with your workspace url.

If you used our extension for a project before, we will migrate it automatically.

See [our documentation for more information](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/vscode-ext/index.html#migrate-a-project-to-a-databricks-project).

### <a id="no-env"></a> No environment variables in terminals

The extension no longer injects databricks environment variables in VSCode terminals. If you were relying on this feature, you will need to manually load the `.databricks/.databricks.env` file in your terminal before running any commands that require those variables.
