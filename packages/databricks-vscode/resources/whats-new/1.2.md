# Databricks Extension v1.2.0

## What's new?

-   [ðŸ“— Advanced notebook support with Databricks Connect](#dbconnect-notebook)

## <a id="dbconnect-notebook"></a> Advanced notebook support with Databricks Connect

Before this update, you could already run notebooks locally with Databricks Connect. This update introduces advanced notebook support. This advanced support enables you to run notebooks locally with a similar experience as you have by running them on a Databricks cluster. The goal of this update is to bring much of the convenience of running notebooks on a Databricks cluster to your local development environment.

This update includes:

-   [Magic commands such as `%run` and `%sql`](#magic-commands)
-   [Preconfigured globals such as `spark` and `dbutils`](#preconf-globals)
-   [Interactive widgets through `dbutils.widgets`](#widgets)
-   [Support for Databricks notebooks](#dbnb)

### <a id="magic-command"></a>Magic commands

You can now use Databricks magic commands locally from your notebooks.

### <a id="preconf-globals"></a>Preconfigured globals

Just like on a Databricks cluster, this update configures and provides you with some globals such as `spark` and `dbutils` when you run notebooks locally.

You can now use `dbutils.widgets` to create interactive widgets in your local notebooks.
